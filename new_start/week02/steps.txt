we build out a robust ResNet from the Regnet space and train

in week 01 we would have many false posatives.(meaning we predict medication taking when it did not occur) we will try to fix that here.

In Dir 00_no_movemnt
- we will NOT remove "No movments to see if those were tricking the model"
        - We find they are not significalty causing the false posative and actualt it make the performace worse if we dont remove them so we continue to remove them


In 01_
- we will augment the weight in the loss function for the positive class
- meaning the medication class with be weighted less resulting in more emphasis on the daily living class
        - We find that yes doing  a weight of about 0.87 for the posativ eweight helps

PAUSE!! 
We find this model is too deep we now go back to the simple SNN and repeat these experiments in week03
