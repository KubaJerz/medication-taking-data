we build an mlp and a simple cnn to see how they work

The mlp doe snot work well at all as expected. But we are able to sucesfly over fit on one batch with the mlp

When we use the CNN we are sucefful.
Much more than actually expected. We get up to a 91 macro f1 but not their is full data leakadge.
However this is how the paper was written so we will move forward with the full data leakadge for the poster.
Next we wil build a more robust netowrk anmd train proparly
